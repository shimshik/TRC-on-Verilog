# FMS-on-Verilog
 Software description of triggers, registers, and counters for microprocessors.


In this project, basic microprocessor components such as various flip-flops/latches, registers, and counters were described in software using Verilog. Based on these components, state machines of both types were developed, and drivers for displaying information on a seven-segment display were created. A model simulating the operation of the train device was then developed using the state machines. The pinout was mapped to the board, and the results were tested. No errors were found, indicating that the components were described correctly.
